    <h2>1.Different var, let, const-</h2>
    <p>let: The let keyword declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
        Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the block it was declared in, which is usually
        denoted by curly braces {}.</p>
    <p>var: The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
        Function-scoped means that the variable is only available within the function it was declared in. Global
        variables are available throughout your entire code.</p>
    <p>const: The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant variable, i.e. a variable that can’t be
        reassigned.
        Constants are also called “immutable variables”, but that’s a bit of a misnomer since they are actually
        variables – just ones that can’t be reassigned.</p>

    <h2> Arrow function vs regular function</h2>
    <p>Regular Function:Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this value (aka the execution context) is dynamic.

        The dynamic context means that the value of this depends on how the function is invoked. In JavaScript, there
        are 4 ways you can invoke a regular function.</p>
    <p>As seen in the previous section, the regular function can easily construct objects.</p>
    <p>Inside the body of a regular function, arguments is a special array-like object containing the list of arguments
        with which the function has been invoked.</p><br>
    <p>Arrow Function: The behavior of this inside of an arrow function differs considerably from the regular function's
        this behavior. The arrow function doesn't define its own execution context.</p>
    <p>A consequence of this resolved lexically is that an arrow function cannot be used as a constructor.</p>
    <p>On the other side, no arguments special keyword is defined inside an arrow function.</p>

    <h2>Map vs Foreach vs filter vs find</h2>
    <p>.forEach() is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it
        returns undefined.</p>
    <p>.map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.</p>
    <p>.filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the
        elements that return truthy for the criteria.</p>
    <p>.find() is also a search function like the previous but they differ in one small detail — this function returns
        only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the function will return the first that has
        matched.</p>
